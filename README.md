### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I've improved my skills over hover selector, flexbox, changing the cursor to pointer and making an overlay.

css
.proud-of-this-css 

h1:hover, .Wyvern:hover   
 {
   color:hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
   cursor: pointer; }

### Continued development

I'd like to refine my grouping selector, trying to make my code shorter, also more resposive.


### Useful resources

- [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This was really helpful while I was trying to make the overlay over the image, their explamation was really simple and clear.
